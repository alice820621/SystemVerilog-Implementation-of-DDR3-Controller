# SystemVerilog-Implementation-of-DDR3-Controller
The controller is a Verilog implementation through a state machine structure per Micro datasheet specifications, and connected to a predefined DDR3 memory. Successful design verification is achieved via a specialized test bench and connected to provided AHB by a SystemVerilog interface.
